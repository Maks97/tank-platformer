# tank-platformer
A simple platformer made in JavaScript, using Phaser, for a JavaScript class. Very much not yet finished (currently only has movement, with some other mechanics coming in later). 

Distributed 
under ISC.


# Installation
You will either need your own web server config, or you can use Python's SimpleHTTPServer in the repo's directory. (using the  "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" command)
After that you can run "127.0.0.1:[port]" from your browser. (at least if you're going with the Python server, the actual address might vary if you're using a different webserver.)

(The comments in the .html file are in Polish but given this is a "babby's first Phaser game" (or really first "real" game in general), there's not much that shouldn't be self-explanatory.)

#Known issues
None? Until the next feature arrives, at any rate!
